# Rust Push to GitHub

## Overview
This Rust utility, named `push` is designed to streamline your Git workflow by providing a simplified interface for common Git operations, including adding changes, committing, and pushing to GitHub. With features such as colored output, emojis for status indicators, and flexibility in pushing to different branches, this tool enhances the Git experience.

## Features
1. Colored Output: The tool leverages color codes to provide visually intuitive feedback on the status of Git operations.

2. Emoji Indicators: Emojis are used to convey status information, making it easy to interpret the output at a glance.
